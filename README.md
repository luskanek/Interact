## Installation
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/luskanek/Interact/releases/latest/download/Interact.zip)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file
3. Move the extracted contents to your World of Warcraft directory (overwrite if updating)
   
> [!NOTE]
> If you're using the Turtle WoW launcher, you can skip steps 4 and 5 and instead enable the mod in the `Mods` tab within the launcher.

4. In your World of Warcraft directory, open `dlls.txt` (included with [VanillaFixes](https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes)) and add `Interact.dll` on a new line at the end of the `dlls.txt` file
5. Launch the game using `VanillaFixes.exe`

If you've done everything correctly, you should be able to find two new bindings named 'Interact' and 'Interact (auto-loot)' in your keybindings menu (they bindings should be located at the end of the keybindings list). To interact with a nearby object, assign a key to the desired binding and press the associated key.
