## Interact

Interact is a mod that allows you to bind a key which you can then use to interact with the world around you. Using the key you will be able to pick herbs, mine veins, loot enemies and much more without the need to use the mouse to target the object.

The mod works by comparing the distances of visible objects that are close to the player. The best candidate for interaction is then selected on a number of conditions (closest, is lootable, is skinnable).

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The mod is intended to be used with [VanillaFixes](https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes). Install VanillaFixes first before proceeding with the installation of Interact.

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/luskanek/Interact/releases/latest/download/Interact.zip)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file
3. Move the extracted contents to your World of Warcraft directory (overwrite if needed)
4. In your World of Warcraft directory, open `dlls.txt` (included with VanillaFixes) and add `Interact.dll` on a new line at the end of the `dlls.txt` file
5. Launch the game using `VanillaFixes.exe`, log in and check if your Add-ons list contains the `Interact` add-on

If you've done everything correctly, you should be able to find a new keybinding called 'Interact' in your keybindings menu (it should be located at the end of the keybindings list).

To interact with a nearby object, press the associated key. You can press the key again to loot all items if the loot window is open.
